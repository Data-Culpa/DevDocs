# Data Culpa Validator UI Overview

## Header bar

The header bar provides access to top-level controls throughout most of the UI.

The drop down on the left provides access to all your watchpoints; the single gear configures the current watchpoint, and the multi-gear configures the system as a whole.


## Tab Groups

Tab groups provide a way to view a specific watchpoint at a specific point in time for comparison.

## Logs

Important log messages bubble up to the top-level alerts, but some messages may be useful to verify operation. You can also embed your own messages with the API if needed for debugging your own connectors and associating messages or code paths with loaded data.
